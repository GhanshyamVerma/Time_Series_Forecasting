# Ranking Based Selective Ensemble Approach

Obtaining reasonably precise forecasts for time series datasets is a major challenge in many domains of science, engineering, and finance. Numerous research evidences show that combining forecasts from multiple structurally different models substantially improves the forecasting accu- racy as well as often outperforms all component models. In this study, an ensemble methodology is proposed that ranks the component models on the basis of their in-sample absolute errors and then selectively combines the forecasts from a predefined number of high ranked models. Thus, only a group of better performing models are combined and others are discarded. Empirical analysis is conducted with nine individual models on four real-world time series datasets. Obtained results clearly demonstrate that the proposed method has attained consistently better accuracies than all component models as well as several other popular forecasts combination mechanisms. As such, this study justifies the superiority of selective ensemble over combining all available forecasts.
